# Smart Systems

Smart systems are large-scale, physically-distributed services where
different kinds of data-collection sensors are used to supply
information employed to efficiently manage assets and resources, and
provide efficient operations. These systems are increasingly pervasive
and interact extensively with their environment. It is thus crucial
that unexpected and possibly dangerous situations be avoided. Hence,
there is a strong need of techniques to guarantee that systems are
trustworthy. Here trustworthiness is a holistic property, encompassing
different characteristics (safety, security, integrity, availability,
correctness, reliability, resilience) that are not addressed in
isolation but as a whole at system level.
