description: "Lazy-CSeq is a context-bounded verification tool for sequentially consistent C programs using POSIX threads. Lazy-CSeq handles the full C language and the main parts of the POSIX thread API, such as dynamic thread creation and deletion, and synchronization via thread join, locks, and condition variables. It supports assertion checking and deadlock detection, and returns counterexamples in case of errors. Lazy-CSeq outperforms other concurrency verification tools and has won several times the concurrency category of SV-COMP."
