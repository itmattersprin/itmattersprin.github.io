description: Lazy-CSeq is a context-bounded verification tool (developed within the CSeq framework) for sequentially consistent C programs using POSIX threads. It handles an extensive fragment of the C language and the main parts of the POSIX thread API, such as dynamic thread creation and deletion, and synchronization via thread join, locks, and condition variables. It supports assertion checking and deadlock detection, and returns counterexamples in case of errors. Lazy-CSeq has won several times the concurrency category of SV-COMP."
