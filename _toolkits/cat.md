description: "The Contract Automata Toolkit groups a set of tools for contract automata. It currently features the Contract Automata Library (CATLib), the Contract Automata App (CATApp) and the Contract Automata Runtime Environment (CARE). CATLib is the main repository and implements contract automata and their main operations: composition of contracts,  synthesis of orchestration, choreographies and most permissive controller. CATApp is a GUI front-end and CARE is a runtime environment for realising service applications specified using contract automata."
