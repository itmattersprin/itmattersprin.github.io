# The case studies of {{ site.title }}

To validate the techniques, methodologies, and tools developed in the
project we will consider three application scenarios that deal with
smart systems of different scales:

- Smart Cities
- Smart Transportation
- Smart Housing

These case studies are apt testbeds for the application and validation
of the foundational theories, methods and tools developed in the
project. All three call for runtime monitoring to control the
interactions of the involved cyber-physical system. Moreover, smart
transportation systems advocate the use of formal methods and
model-checking tools to improve their scheduling and operation, next
to safety and design time analysis. The enforcement of non-functional
properties like energy efficiency and security are paramount for the
success of smart city and housing systems.

## Smart Cities
The Centre for Urban Informatics and Modeling at the GSSI promotes and
develops research and technology transfer projects, situated in the
post-disaster context of the city of L'Aquila. The main focus of the
centre is to make L'Aquila a "smart city". One of the first core
projects is devoted to "Environmental Monitoring", with the aim of
collecting and analyzing data to make informed decisions to improve
the quality of life in the city. This involves the management of a
large number of sensors, whose behaviour needs

- to be modelled,
- verified during pre-deployment and
- monitored at runtime.

These activities will be performed as part of this case study. Runtime
monitoring for IoT systems is a challenging task for developers since
the interaction among sensors, APIs and systems can be very
complicated, and the amount of collected data can be huge.

## Smart Transportation
The formal Methods and Tools group of the CNR has longstanding
experience in the modelling and analysis of smart transportation
systems, from bike-sharing to train-signalling systems. While
satellite-based positioning systems have been in use for quite some
time now in avionics and automotive sectors to provide accurate
positioning and smart route planning, their application in the railway
sector for moving block distancing and automatic driving is one of the
current challenges of the EU H2020 Shift2Rail initiative. The railway
sector's robust safety requirements call for the use of
state-of-the-art formal methods and tools for modelling and analysing
technological advances during their development and for monitoring
them at runtime.

## Smart Housing
The new Campus that is going be built at the University of Camerino
after the 2016 earthquake will be integrated with a framework for
"smart housing". With smart housing we indicate a building that
includes a system of devices that allow one to monitor and control
activities and services. We will use the techniques developed in the
project to develop a framework that, by integrating runtime monitoring
techniques driven by the analyses performed at design time, allows for
the enforcement of non-functional properties like efficiency
(reduction of energy consumption) and security.
