# Soon

## Introduction

Soon is a Jekyll site that produces a "coming soon" page.  You can preview
the site [here](https://kelvinmo.github.io/soon).

Additional optional features include:

* A countdown clock
* Mailing list subscription form
* Social media links

## Customisation

The main content can be customised in `index.md`.

Most of the configuration can be done in `_config.yml`.  Fine-tuning of
styles and additional content can be done in `soon.scss` and the
partials in the `_includes` directory.

The styles are largely based on a heavily simplified version of
[Bulma](https://bulma.io).
